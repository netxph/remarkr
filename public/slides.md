# Dynamic Duo
- Jan is already Full-Time NCA
- Able to increase our flow
- More NCA features rolled-in
---
# NCA at the Center
- NCA Manila Central Hub
- Supporting most Navitaire Projects in Manila Time
- Most builds happen in Manila
- QA is situated in Manila
- And, we still take part in creating new features in NCA
- ~300 Manila Navitaire Employees
- Plus, we still handle US transitioned support

## ... we are the Dynamic Duo :)
---
# So, How is this Working
- Working Independently - key
- Deep technical skills
- Quick decisions
    - ... that complies with NCA's practices

## ... our collaboration with Counterparts
- Weekly NCA Meeting
- Monthly Individual Checkpoint with Kyle
- Frequent Geek Chats
---
# NCA Manila - Infancy -> Manhood
- "Soft" start last year
    - Assessing where we are

- Able to see a lot of weak points
    - Standard process
    - Being a "team"
    - Monitoring quality
---
# Set a Vision

## I'd like to see the future of NCA Manila as:
### - Central Support
### - Cascading NCA's Best Practices through training
### - Making innovations
## These must be executed with speed and quality

---
# Daily Work
## Based on our Vision
1. Support
2. NCA New Features
3. Skills improvement through training

---
# So... we started lean
## We started implementing small things at a time
### Less Meetings, More Informal Chats
    - Tasks are posted in our Task Board
    - Questions and clarifications are done informally
    - Updates are gathered from Task Board
### Less Process, More Communication
    - Bug reporting in NCA is informal (through email)
    - Internal process in NCA (through guide questions)
---
# Lean
### Quality in mind EVERYDAY
    - Check-in/Shelve often
    - Daily code review (through TFS)
### Fast response, Fast feedback
    - We value feedback MORE
    - Give back, by giving fast response

# The Case of NCS Analytics
- It's a new SERVICE made from scratch of NCA
- Service type is standalone - second of its kind in NCA
- Only project with 2 products in mind
- All-Manila development
- Development May 21 - July 11

## Analytics is made of:
- Pricing Engine
- Experimentation Engine
- Rules Engine
- Caching
- Management
- Testing tools

# The Case of NCS Analytics

### Wicked Problem

"A problem cannot be fully defined unless it is solved at least once"

- CAD is documented in 2 days
    - Contains mostly how we perceive the app will act
    - The API and the contracts
    - Overall architecture
        - How NS and TC will communicate
    - Around ~10 pages (excluding title page, etc)

---
# The Case of NCS Analytics

- Development started immediately after that
- First is setting up the API
- Database is mocked/stubbed
- Challenge of having 2 products waiting
    - Changes in the document happens almost everyday
    - Functionality and feature changes
    - Contracts are locked on the latter part

---
# How we handle CHANGES
- We know it will be inevitable
- We structured our code to be modular
    - Proper use of Dependency Injection
- Strict implementation of Unit tests
    - 207 unit tests
    - We will know if something is broken
- Kept modules small
    - No GOD classes
- We constantly update (put more details) to our CAD and submitted regularly to group
- Kept communication open
    - Jason is almost always online in our morning to handle our questions
- Jason's dedication to this project
- Use TFS Tools + Task Board for self-management
---
# TL;DR
- It really speed up our development
- Effective self-management
- Rough edges on ensuring quality
    - But because of fast feedback, we are able fix it immediately
- Still work in progress

## Overall, it proves that this process is really effective, and we will continue to improve it in our future projects
---
# ... Important Key, Skills
- To be able to pull this off we need to continually improve our skills
- Each of us is encourage to have "Project Initiative"
- A day in a week (unless it's a very busy week)
- Find out our learning profile
- Experiment - Work in progress
---
# Our Current Capability

## Note: Lower number is better

- Marc - 10
- Jan - 18

## Goal: To improve this rating this Fiscal Year
