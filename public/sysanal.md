# Map Snapchat
I would like to create a mobile application that make use of images as a way to communicate with friends. To focus more on the image, we'd like to make them temporary so the user can concentrate on analyzing the image in a short period of time. Although primarily we want the image as the message it self, we would allow the user to place captions to images. It is also important that images cannot be viewed after specified time.

# Agile Software Development
- Not a set of tools
- Nor a single methodology

## Philosphy defined by its manifesto
---
# Agile Manifesto
## We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
- Individuals and interactions over Processes and tools
- Working software over Comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over  Contract negotiation
- Responding to change over Following a plan
## That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
---
# Individuals and interactions
- Away from relying heavily to processes
- More talking
- More interaction
- Co-location, Pair programming
---
# Working software
- Feedback is very important
- Hard to visualize when reading the documentation
- Customers prefer working product
- Everybody hates reading documentation
---
# Customer Collaboration
- Requirements cannot be fully collected at the beginning 
- Customer interaction should be until the product is done 
- We are with customers instead of against them
# Responding to Change
- Accepts that there's always be 'wicked problem'
- Agile must respond quickly to change
- Continuous development

# Scrums
## We're losing the relay race
### The 'relay race' approach to product development, may conflict with the goals of maximum speed and flexibility. Instead a holistic or 'rugby' approach - where a team tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth - may better serve today's competitive requirements.

# Scrum in 100 words
## Scrum is an agile process that allows us to focus on delivering the highest business value in the shortest time
## It allows us to rapidly and repeatedly inspect actual working software
## The business sets the priorities. Teams self-organize to determine the best way to deliver the highest priority features
## Every two weeks to a month anyone can see real working software and decide to release it as is or continue to enhance it for another sprint

# Scrum Characteristics
- Self-organizing teams
- Product progresses in a series of month long sprints
- Requirements are captured as items in a list of 'product backlog'
- No specific engineering practices prescribed
- Uses generative rules to create an agile environment for delivering projects
- A tool of 'Agile'

# Sprints
- Scrum projects make progress in a series of "sprints"
- Typical duration is 2-4 weeks or a calendar month at most
- A constant duration leads to a better rhythm
- Product is designed, coded, and tested during sprint
---
# vs. Waterfall
- Sequential vs. Ovelapping
- Do little things at a time
- ... rather than doing all at once
- Quick wins
- Feeling of satisfaction
---
# No Changes
- Rule of thumb, no changes during sprint
- Plan sprint durations around how long you can commit to keeping change out of the sprint
---
# Scrum Framework
## Roles
- Product owner
- Scrum Master
- Team

# Scrum Master
- The "Project Manager"
- Represents management to the project
- Responsible for enacting Scrum values and practices
- Removes impediments
- Ensure the team is fully functional and productive
- Enable close cooperation across all roles and functions
- Shield the team from external interferences
---
# The Team
- Consists of "Developers" and "Quality Assurance"
- Others "User Experience", "Designers", "Database Administrators"
- Self organizing
- Membership should change only between sprints
---
class: center, middle, inverse
## Now we know casts, let's proceed with activities
# The Ceremonies
---
# Sprint Planning
## Sprint Prioritization
- Analyze and evaluate product backlog
- Select sprint goal

## Sprint Planning
- Decide how to achieve sprint goal
- Create sprint backlog, from product backlog items
- Estimate sprint backlog in hours
---
## Sprint Planning
- Team selects item from the product backlog
- Sprint backlog is created
 - Tasks are identified and each is estimated (1-16 hours)
 - Collaboratively, not done alone by the Scrum Master
- High-level design is considered

- Designing a solution by representing components as software objects
---
# Classes vs. Objects
## Definition
- Class is mechanism of binding data members and associated methods in a single unit
- Object is an instance of class

## Existence
- Class has logical existence
- Object has physical existence

## Declaration
- Class is defined once
- Objects can be created as many times as you require
---
class: center, middle, inverse
## In OOD, we design the objects that will interact in the system
# We design the classes
---
# Discovering Classes
## Simple Rule (text)
- Look for nouns in descriptions
- Obviously not all nouns are classes
- But at least this method can allow one to create list of candidate classes

## Simple Rule (visual)
- Examine the display infront of you
- List all the things that is being talked about
- Randomly select an attribute or an input field and analyze to which that control belongs to

class: center, middle, inverse
## After defining the class, 
# Let's gather all it's attributes and behaviour
---
# Behaviours
- Verbs
- These are actions to and of an object
- In software these are the methods and functions
---
# Attributes
- Adjectives
- Things that describes the object
- In software these are properties or fields
---
class: center, middle, inverse
## No Class is an Island
# Relationships between classes
---
# Class Relationships
- Inheritance
- Aggregation
- Dependency
---
# Inheritance
- "Is-a" relationship
- Relationship between a more general class (superclass) and a more specialized class (subclass)
---
# Aggregation
- "Has-a" relationship
- Objects of one class contain references to objects of another class
---
# Dependency
- When a class uses another class' methods
- This is a "Uses" relationship
---
class: center, middle, inverse
## Now we have a class
## Let's describe the process of becoming an object
# The Process of Instantiation
---
# Object Instantiation
## Characteristics
### Identity
- Specific property settings have been made for attributes of the class. This distinguishes it from other objects

### State
- Describes the data stored in the object

### Behavior
- Describes the methods in the object's interface through which the object can be used
---
# Instantiating a Dog
- Class: DOG
- Attributes
 - Name = Scooby Doo
 - Height = 36
 - Weight = 145
- Abilities
 - Bark

## With these classes and objects defined
# Let's start modelling them and put them to writing
---
class: center, middle, inverse
# ... collaborate
# ... communicate
---
class: center, middle, inverse
# ... one language
---
# Visual vs. Text
As we know, we don't have much tolerance to worded presentation.
A good example is this slide. If you put your slides in paragraph
as this one, normally no one bothers to read it from start to end.
Only lawyers has tolerance in writing such lengthy document. Because
their intention really is to hide sneaky "clauses in their document.
This is never the case in software development.

# Visual vs. Text
Software Development
- Clear communication
- Prefer visual
- It plays with imagination

# Introducing, Unified Modelling Language
---
# UML
- Created in 1997
- Object Management Group
- Intended to provide common design language
- For computer applications
- A language similar to building designs and blueprints
---
# UML
Not an overnight success
- Open standard
- Programming language independent
- Language not a methodology
- Does not contradict to companies' methodology
---
# UML
Diagrams
- Use-case diagram
- Class diagram
- Sequence diagram
- Component diagram
- Deployment diagram
---
# Use-case diagram
- Illustrates unit of functionality
- Help visualize functional requirements of system
- Shows relationship of actors to essential processes
---
# Use-case diagram
- Easy to illustrate
- Stick picture of a man (Actor)
- Oval (Process)
- Lines (Relationship)
---
# Class diagram
- Shows how different entities relates to each other
- People, data, things
- ... Nouns in the system
- Shows static structure of system
---
# Class diagram
Logical
- Entities familiar to business people
Classes
- Used by programmers
- Guide in translating to actual class
- Object-oriented design
---
# Class diagram
Consists of 3 sections
- Upper: Name of the class
- Middle: Attributes
- Lower: Operations/Actions
Lines
- Shows relationship
- Multiplicity
- Inheritance
---
# Sequence diagram
- Shows detailed flow of specific use case
- Calls between different objects
---
# Sequence diagram
Dimensions
- Vertical
 - Sequence of messages or calls
- Horizontal
 - Instances which messages are sent
---
# Sequence diagram
- Start at the top
 - Identify instances
- Below
 - Illustrate the flow of messages

### Development style varies from company to another
## Let's study the case of...
# The GitHub Flow
---
class: middle, center
## Before we study Github, let's discuss its business
# Git
---
# Revision Control
- Management of changes
 - Codes
 - Documents
 - Programs
 - Any files
- Revision control existed as long as writing existed
 - Seen in books (2nd edition, 3rd edition, etc)
 - Seen in public documents (version 1, 2, etc)
 - School (documents are marked with red ballpens for revisions)
---
# Revision Control
- Any kind of practice that tracks and provides control over changes in source code
- Provides way teams can work on code without worries
- Provides back up repository to code
- Provides means of fallback
---
# Kinds of Revision Control
- Version Control System (VCS)
- Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)

# Git is Distributed Version Control System
---
# Git
- One of the brilliant inventions of Linus Torvalds
- Became frustrated on what current version control system offers
- Inspired from BitKeeper
- Git - from British slang "unpleasant person"
 - "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself"
- "The stupid content tracker"
---
# Enter Github
- Git repository web-based hosting service
- Offers functionality of Git, as well as adding many of its own features
- Provides web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration
- Provides additional collaboration features
 - wikis
 - task management
 - feature requests
- Largest code host in the world
- Stable amongst open-source development community
- Used as resume
---
# The Tree of Code Revisions
- Let's pause and understand few concepts of Git
 - Cloning
 - Branching
  - Trunk (master)
  - Branches
 - Location
  - Local
  - Remote
---
# The Github Flow
- Lightweight, branch-based workflow
- Supports teams and projects
- Deployments made regularly
---
# Step 1 - Create a branch
- For new ideas/features
- Branching helps you manage your own workflow
- Does not affect master branch
- Free to try, experiment, commit changes
- Won't be merged to master until it's ready to be reviewed
- TIP: Branch names should be decriptive
---
# Step 2 - Add commits
- Time to start making changes
- Commit frequently is a good practice
 - Like our habit of pressing CTRL+S every other second
- Helps you keeps track of your progress
- Let's you undo your work and go back to a known commit state
- TIP: Commit messages are important, be descriptive
---
# Step 3 - Open a Pull Request
- Pull Request initiate discussions on commits
- You can pull request at any point in development process
 - Ask for review
 - Stuck and need help
 - Share some screenshots
 - Present ideas
---
# Step 4 - Discuss and review your code
- Code revisions are displayed
- Discuss on changes
- Provide/supply comments
- Improve the code
- Shoot down bugs
- Provide better solution
---
# Step 5 - Merge and deploy
- Once request is approved
- All test passes
- Time to merge to master
- Can perform merge locally first
- Make sure you'll have smooth merge when done remotely
